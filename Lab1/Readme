Lab-1 Java as Structured programming
Objectives
Compiling and executing Java exercises using loop statements and arrays 
Theory
Making an array in a Java program involves three distinct steps:
1. Declare the array name.
2. Create the array.
3. Initialize the array values.
We refer to an array element by putting its index in square brackets after the array name: the code a[i] 
refers to element i of array a[]. For example, the following code makes an array of n numbers of type 
double, all initialized to 0:
double[] a; // declare the array
a = new double[n]; // create the array
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) // elements are indexed from 0 to n-1
 a[i] = 0.0; // initialize all elements to 0.0
Run the following example for more details. Once complete, then continue to next part of the lab
public class ArrayEjemplo {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 int n = 7;
 // initialize to random values between 0 and 1
 float[] a = new float[n];
 for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
 a[i] = 2*i+3;
 }
 // print array values, one per line
 System.out.println("a[] = ");
 
 for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
 System.out.println(a[i]);
 }
 System.out.println();
 System.out.println();
 // find the maximum
 double max = a[0];
 for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
 if (a[i] > max) max = a[i];
 } System.out.println("max = " + max);
 // average
 double sum = 0.0;
 for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
 sum += a[i];
 }
 System.out.println("average = " + sum / n);
 // copy to another array
 double[] b = new double[n];
 for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
 b[i] = a[i];
 }
 
 // dot product of a[] and b[]
 double dotProduct = 0.0;
 for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
 dotProduct += a[i] * b[i];
 }
 System.out.println("dot product of a[] and b[] = " + dotProduct);
 }
}

Exercises
This Section is intended to star in lab session, but you need to complete out the class and deliver the 
next lab-session.
1. Write an application that inputs five integers from the user and displays the positive numbers 
greater than 10. If no numbers exists, print the message “No hay numero” (there is no number)

2. Given and array of 10 numbers, write a program that finds the two smallest numbers. In 
addition, the program should return the index of the numbers.

3. Given the following array: A = {95,70, 65,45, 85,100}
Assume that the array represents the final grades of six students. The grades are reported 
according to the following standard grading system: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (0-
59). Write a program that print the letters of each grade
