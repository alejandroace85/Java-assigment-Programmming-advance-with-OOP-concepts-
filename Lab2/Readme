Lab-2: Structured Programming in Java - II

Objectives
You will learn:
1. Declaring and initializing arrays
2. Comparing input to array elements.
3. Preventing array out-of-bounds errors

Exercise

1. Create a 1x8 vector of integers. Write a program with two methods; the first method finds 
the number “5” in the vector. The other method counts the odd numbers in vector. Print all 
results.

2. Given two Arrays A= {2,4,7,8,3) and B={11,3,2,12,13). Write a program that find the common 
numbers in both arrays. Print the values in a new array “C”

3. Write a program that input two arrays and print the difference C = A-B, i.e. the values in A 
that is not in B
