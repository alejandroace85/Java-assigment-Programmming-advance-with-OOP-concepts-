Classes and Objects

Objectives
1. Create class and methods
2. Testing classes
3. Accessing instance variables.
4. Use variables and methods

Exercises
1. Given the array A= [ 2, -3, 4, -10, 1, -1, 2, -3]. Write a program in Java that perform three tasks using 
the following methods:
a. int suma() : Sum the positive numbers
b. Int Posicion(): Find the position of the element -1
c. Int Operacion(): Find the operation M = (sum negative numbers) x 2
Create two classes: one containing the methods and other that test all methods with objects. Print all 
results

2. Using the previous example perform the following changes:
a. Create a constructor with initialize el array with the elements [22 1 0 -8 -1 3 3 1 22 3 1]
b. In addition to the previous methods, create a method that find the frequency that every element
in the array are repeated(for example element 22 is repeated two times )
Create a “test class” and print all result
