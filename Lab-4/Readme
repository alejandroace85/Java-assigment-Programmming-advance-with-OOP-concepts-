Lab-3 Classes and Objects
Objectives
1. Create class and methods
2. Testing classes
3. Accessing instance variables.
4. Use variables and methods

Exercises
1. Create a program that find the area of a triangle using a method named area(double base, double 
altura). 

The class “triangulo.java” has two constructor:
public triangulo(): initialize the “base” and “altura” of the 
triangle(dafault)
public triangulo(int b,int h): initialize the base and “altura”. The values 
are entered by keyboard

Test the program creating two objects. The first object use the constructor triangulo () and the 
second object the constructor triangulo (int base, int altura). 

2. Write a program named “arreglo.java” that find the average and the maximum value in an array 
of five integers (positives and negatives). The class contains a static variable named sum that 
contains the sum of elements of the array. The program has two constructors:

public arreglo (): initialize the array in this method
public arreglo (int a[]): initialize the array. The array is entered by user in 
the test program.

In addition, create the static method positivos () that find the number of positive numbers.
Test the program with three objects using the two constructors. Print all results.
